## üéØ About

QuickCaf√© revolutionizes caf√© discovery by combining location data with AI-powered analysis of caf√© vibes and amenities. Unlike traditional platforms that only show ratings and reviews, we understand the actual atmosphere and features of each caf√©.

### The Problem
Finding the right caf√© isn't just about location - it's about finding a space that matches your mood and needs. Traditional review platforms don't capture the "vibe" or specific amenities you're looking for.

### Our Solution
QuickCaf√© uses AI to analyze thousands of reviews and data points to understand caf√© characteristics and match them to your preferences.

## üèó System Design

### Architecture Components

1. **Frontend (SvelteKit)**
   - Server-side rendering for performance
   - Real-time streaming updates
   - Progressive web app capabilities

2. **Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)**
   ```sql
   -- Core Tables
   cafes (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       google_place_id TEXT UNIQUE,
       name TEXT,
       location POINT,
       price_level TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP
   )

   cafe_vibes (
       cafe_id UUID REFERENCES cafes(id),
       vibe_category TEXT,
       confidence_score FLOAT,
       analyzed_at TIMESTAMP
   )

   cafe_amenities (
       cafe_id UUID REFERENCES cafes(id),
       amenity TEXT,
       confidence_score FLOAT,
       analyzed_at TIMESTAMP
   )
   ```

3. **Caching (Upstash Redis)**
   - Location-based caching with 24-hour TTL
   - Cache key format: `location:{lat}:{lng}:{price_range}`
   - 5km radius coverage per cache entry
   - Coordinate rounding to 4 decimal places for better cache hits

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **Initial Search**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       User->>+Server: Search Request
       Server->>+Redis: Check Cache
       Redis-->>-Server: Cache Hit/Miss
       Server->>+Google: If Cache Miss
       Google-->>-Server: Places Data
       Server->>+DB: Store New Places
       DB-->>-Server: Confirmation
       Server->>+OpenAI: Analyze Reviews
       OpenAI-->>-Server: Vibe/Amenity Scores
       Server->>+DB: Store Analysis
       DB-->>-Server: Confirmation
       Server-->>-User: Stream Results
   ```

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Geocode location ‚Üí 5km radius search
   - Filter and deduplicate results
   - Batch process reviews (3 cafes at a time)
   - Store results in PostgreSQL
   - Cache location results in Redis

## üéØ Recommendation Engine

### Scoring System

1. **Vibe Scoring (40% weight)**
   ```typescript
   interface VibeScore {
       primary: number;      // Direct mood match (0-1)
       secondary: number;    // Complementary vibes bonus (0.7 weight)
       final: number;       // Combined vibe score
   }
   ```

2. **Complementary Vibes Map**
   ```typescript
   const vibeRelations = {
       cozy: ['quiet', 'traditional'],
       modern: ['artistic', 'industrial'],
       quiet: ['cozy', 'traditional'],
       lively: ['modern', 'artistic'],
       artistic: ['modern', 'industrial'],
       traditional: ['cozy', 'quiet'],
       industrial: ['modern', 'artistic']
   }
   ```

3. **Scoring Weights**
   ```typescript
   const weights = {
       vibe: 0.4,        // Primary factor
       amenity: 0.3,     // Required features
       distance: 0.2,    // Location proximity
       price: 0.1        // Price match
   }
   ```

4. **Final Score Calculation**
   ```typescript
   finalScore = (
       vibeScore * weights.vibe +
       amenityScore * weights.amenity +
       distanceScore * weights.distance +
       priceScore * weights.price
   )
   ```

### Ranking Process

1. **Initial Filtering**
   - Location-based search within 5km
   - Price range filter (if specified)
   - Basic amenity requirements

2. **Score Calculation**
   - Direct vibe match
   - Complementary vibe bonuses (0.7 weight)
   - Amenity match scoring (0.5 default for missing scores)
   - Distance penalty calculation
   - Price match scoring (0.3 for near matches)

3. **Result Ranking**
   - Sort by final score
   - Return top 5 recommendations
   - Include up to 15 other options

### Recent Improvements

1. **Enhanced Scoring**
   - More lenient complementary vibe scoring (0.7 weight)
   - Default amenity scores (0.5) for missing data
   - Improved price matching with partial scores
   - Better handling of missing scores

2. **Detailed Descriptions**
   - Rich, contextual caf√© descriptions
   - Atmosphere details based on vibe scores
   - Notable amenity highlights
   - Specific space and ambiance information

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Consistent recommendation display
   - Clear feature highlighting
   - Better distance and price visibility
   - Improved recommendation parsing

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

1. **Recommendation API**
   ```typescript
   POST /api/getRecommendation
   {
       location: string,      // e.g., "San Francisco"
       mood: VibeCategory,    // e.g., "cozy"
       priceRange?: string,   // "$" to "$$$"
       requirements?: string[] // e.g., ["wifi", "outdoor_seating"]
   }
   ```

2. **Response Streaming**
   - Server-sent events for real-time updates
   - Progress indicators during analysis
   - Chunked recommendation delivery

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Cache Strategy**
   - Geospatial indexing
   - Coordinate rounding for cache efficiency
   - 24-hour TTL with manual invalidation
   - Batch processing for analysis

2. **Performance**
   - Parallel processing of caf√© analysis
   - Efficient PostgreSQL queries
   - Streaming responses
   - Edge function deployment
